RoBERTa (short for “Robustly Optimized BERT Approach”) is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, which was developed by researchers at Facebook AI. Like BERT, RoBERTa is a transformer-based language model that uses self-attention to process input sequences and generate contextualized representations of words in a sentence.
